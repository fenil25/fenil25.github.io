			<p>Figuring out why that was the case is a fascinating endeavor. In an age where cable networks consistently produce the most compelling, rich, and progressive hour-long character studies and epic tales, the rules have drastically changed. Decades ago, procedurals were all the rage, and none of them exhibited the degrees of cinematic storytelling now seen on channels like <strong>HBO</strong>, <strong>AMC</strong>, and <strong>FX</strong>.</p>

Not at all, which is why the following list represents our best effort to assess TV's 50 finest examples of dramatic excellence based on creative merits more so than time-period reflections. Besides, it's not like anyone's energy would be wasted sampling any of these shows on any given day. After all, greatness speaks for itself.</p>
