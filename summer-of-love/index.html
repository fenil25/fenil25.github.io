    <p><i>We have been together for almost a year now. From spending nights at 500A to studying at Vidyavihar to having an awesome summer in California, we have come a long way.
      It does not seem like that it was just merely 314 days. It seems like an eternity. I have spent some of the best days of my life with you. Can you believe that? 
      Like out of the 8800 days, I have lived, I have spent the best days out of those 8800 days with you. Assuming a uniform distribution, the probability is just 3.5%. 
      I mean against these whopping odds, you have showed me the craziest and the most wonderful moments of my life. 
    </i>
    </p>
    <p>I hope we can relive our best days of our life - watching series on projector, cooking food, studying together, working together, playing together, just being together.
      I love you to the moon and back. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying out new cuisines and cocktails in San Francisco, Mountain View, Amherst, to New York, we have travelled the US together. Here is to more and more trips. 
      From our first date to Johnnys tavern to our last day to Fresh side (till now), I have had the best meals with the best company that I could have asked for. 
      Just seeing you sitting across the table smiling makes my day, month and year. I can still picture everything, all of our dates, Johnnys tavern, Taste of Thai, 
      Crazy noodles, sick date at Miss Saigon, expensive date at Tropisueno, North India on the 2nd street, Dhamaka at New York, bad American place after ourbroadway show and many more.
      At the time I did not realize, but looking back, every bit, every millisecond spent with you, looking at you, being with you has given me infinite happiness. 
      Not just the planned dates, but even all the unplanned ones, in UMass, at MV, at SF, calling you in college if I am free, studying and doing assignments together
      at Student Union, 24-hour dates and what not. I am going to miss every bit of it. If you even had 1% of the fun that I had, I hope you say yes to my proposition to go on a date with me on 14th February 2023. 
    </p>
    <p>So, Will you?</p>
